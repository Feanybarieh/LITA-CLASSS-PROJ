# LITA-CLASS-PROJECT

### Project Title: Data analysis on Excel and SQL
### Project Overview

The below analysis aims to show my work from the training held by an organization called Incubator Hub. The program therefore was named LITA(Ladies in Tec Africa).
Many try and errors were present in my works during the training and would therefore be portrayed here.

### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel for Data cleaning, Analysis and visualization.
  
- SQL Server - Structured Query Language for Quring of Data.

- Github for portfolio building.
 
### Data Analysis
In the inception of the data analysis class held by Mr Mushin, he took us through;
 - How to load data into a dataset.
 - How to clean data especially the names using proper, upper lower function on Excel.
 - Handling missing values and duplicate data.
 - The function used to import data from a table to another table using Vlookup.
