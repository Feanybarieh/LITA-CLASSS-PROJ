# LITA-CLASS-PROJECT

### Project Title: Data analysis on Excel and SQL
### Project Overview

The below analysis aims to show my work from the training held by an organization called Incubator Hub. The program therefore was named LITA(Ladies in Tec Africa).
Many try and errors were present in my works during the training and would therefore be portrayed here.

### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel for Data cleaning, Analysis and visualization.
  
- SQL Server - Structured Query Language for Quring of Data.

- Github for portfolio building.
 
### Data Analysis on Excel.
In the inception of the data analysis class held by Mr Mushin, he took us through;
 - How to load data into a dataset.
 - How to clean data especially the names using proper, upper lower functions in Excel.
 - Handling missing values and duplicate data.
 - The function used to import data from a table to another table using Vlookup.

### Explored Data Analysis
While there was a dummy dataset used for practice, we could answer some questions with the aid of a pivot table.

Below are some of the questions treated;
- Checked out the five top products in a market.
- The total and average sales in a particular market.
- What sales are at its peak.
  
  However, a pictorial representation will be present below.


  ### Data Analysis on SQL
  With the basic Excel knowledge acquired already, we moved on to analysising data on SQL.

  
  Without prior knowledge on SQL, I learnt the following things;
  - How to create a database and store data in it.
  - Creating a table.
  - Inserting Values into a table.
  - Rectifying a column name and adding more records to an existing table.
  - Query optimization( Here a letter can be substituted for a table)
 
    Below is an example code
